# Port the imported Base44 app

## Goal

The user just imported a project from base44.com. Port it from the imported state into the Replit `pnpm_workspace` stack so it runs cleanly in this environment. **It must look and work like the original.**

This app is the user's real product. Treat it like porting someone's live app — every lost feature, broken style, or missing interaction is a regression.

## In scope

- Restructure the imported tree into the Replit `pnpm_workspace` layout (frontend artifact + an `api-server` backed by Replit Postgres + Clerk for auth).
- Replace Base44's SDK shims (`base44.entities.*`, `base44.auth.*`, `base44.integrations.*`) with Replit primitives — see `## Base44-specific notes`.
- Make the app actually run via the Replit workflow.

## Out of scope

- Building new features or refactoring beyond what's needed to run.
- Strict typecheck — use `// @ts-ignore` to keep moving. Visual + functional parity matters more than zero TS errors.
- Fixing bugs that existed before the import.

## Base44-specific notes

Base44 apps follow a very consistent shape — assume this layout:

- **Vite + React, JSX (not TSX)** with a flat `src/` at the repo root.
- **No `server/` directory in the original** — Base44 talks to a hosted SDK, not a backend the user owns.
- **SDK shim files** live at:
  - `src/api/base44Client.js`, `src/api/entities.js`, `src/api/integrations.js`
  - `src/lib/app-params.js`, `src/lib/AuthContext.jsx`
  - `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`, `src/components/UserNotRegisteredError.jsx`
- **`@base44/sdk` and `@base44/vite-plugin`** in `package.json` — remove both as part of the migration.
- **Vite config** wires the Base44 plugin — remove that wiring.

### Replacement map

| Base44 | Replit replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `base44.entities.*` | New `api-server` artifact + `lib/db/` (Drizzle + Postgres) + `/api/*` routes |
| `base44.auth.*` | Clerk (see the authentication skill) |
| `InvokeLLM` / `GenerateImage` / `ExtractDataFromUploadedFile` | AI integrations (OpenAI / Anthropic) — see migration-guardrails skill |
| `UploadFile` | Object storage integration (`javascript_object_storage`) |
| `SendEmail` / `SendSMS` | Integrations skill, else stub |
| `base44.appLogs.*` | Delete (no equivalent needed) |

### Files to delete after the swap

`base44Client.js`, `entities.js`, `integrations.js`, `app-params.js`, `NavigationTracker.jsx`, `VisualEditAgent.jsx`, `UserNotRegisteredError.jsx`. Keep `AuthContext.jsx` only after rewriting it to wrap Clerk.

## Pre-existing scaffold (do NOT remove)

The pnpm_workspace scaffold is already applied. These existed before this task started:

- `artifacts/api-server/` — backend artifact (kind=api).
- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox/` — design/mockup artifact.
- `lib/api-spec/`, `lib/api-client-react/`, `lib/db/` — shared packages.

The existing app's frontend goes into a NEW web artifact created via `createArtifact`. Do NOT put frontend code into `artifacts/api-server/`.

## How to communicate

Short, non-technical updates: "Looking at your project..." → "Setting things up..." → "Moving your app..." → "Wiring up the database..." → "Checking everything works..."

## Steps

### 0. Read the pnpm_workspace skill

Read `.local/skills/pnpm-workspace/SKILL.md` first.

### 1. Detect + install

```sh
bash .local/secondary_skills/migrate-to-multi-artifact/references/fullstack_detect.sh
pnpm install
```

For Base44, expect `CLIENT_DIR=.` (flat) and an empty `ROUTE_LAYOUT` / `SCHEMA_PATH`. Fix any `CONFLICTS` first.

### 2. Read the SDK surface

Read these from `.migration-backup/`:

- `src/api/base44Client.js`, `src/api/entities.js`, `src/api/integrations.js`
- `src/lib/app-params.js`, `src/lib/AuthContext.jsx`
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`, `src/components/UserNotRegisteredError.jsx`
- `vite.config.js`
- `package.json`

Then grep for the actual surface area used:

```sh
grep -rE "base44\.(entities|integrations\.Core|auth)\." .migration-backup/src
```

This enumeration drives the shape of the new `api-server` schema and routes.

### 3. Build the backend

Use `lib/db/` (Drizzle + Postgres) to define tables that match the entities you found in step 2. Use `artifacts/api-server/` to expose `/api/*` routes that match the entity calls.

If the app uses `base44.auth.*`, set up Clerk — see the authentication skill.

For AI integrations (`InvokeLLM`, `GenerateImage`, `ExtractDataFromUploadedFile`), use the corresponding Replit AI integration. For storage (`UploadFile`), use the object storage integration.

Run codegen + DB push in parallel once the spec exists:

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen`
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`

### 4. Copy frontend

```sh
createArtifact({ artifactType: "react-vite", slug: "<app-name>", previewPath: "/", title: "<Title>" })
```

Then run the copy script — do NOT skip this or manually rewrite files instead:

```sh
bash .local/secondary_skills/migrate-to-multi-artifact/references/fullstack_copy_frontend.sh <app-name>
```

The script copies source files from `.migration-backup/` into the new artifact, patches imports, installs dependencies, and handles Base44's flat `src/` layout. Manually rewriting files loses styles, fonts, and subtle markup that the script preserves.

Read the script output and act on it:

- `AGENT TODO` — required edits (vite.config.ts, wouter base path). Do these.
- `SKIPPED` — files intentionally not copied (conflicts). Check if they matter.
- `PATCHED` — automatic fixes applied. No action needed.
- `INSTALLED` — dependencies added. No action needed.

### 5. Replace the SDK + clean up

- **Remove `@base44/sdk` and `@base44/vite-plugin`** from `package.json`. Strip the Base44 plugin from `vite.config.*`.
- **Replace `base44.entities.*` calls** with `fetch` to your new `/api/*` routes (or generated hooks if you wrote an OpenAPI spec).
- **Replace `base44.auth.*`** with Clerk — see the authentication skill.
- **Replace `InvokeLLM` / `GenerateImage` / `ExtractDataFromUploadedFile`** with the matching AI integration.
- **Replace `UploadFile`** with the object storage integration.
- **Delete** the shim files listed in the Base44-specific notes section above.

Verify these are preserved (the copy script handles most, but check):

- **Fonts** — `index.html` Google Fonts `<link>` tags + CSS `--font-sans` variables.
- **Colors / theme** — Base44 apps usually express theme via Tailwind CSS variables in `:root` and `.dark`.
- **Routing** — if using wouter, the `<Router>` must have `base={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}`.

### 6. Verify

Restart the workflow, then use the testing agent (see the testing skill) to exercise the main flows — navigation, auth, entity CRUD. The testing agent will screenshot each step and report failures.

**Replit apps run via workflows, not root-level `pnpm dev`.** Don't run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm run build` at the workspace root.

**What to check**: Does it look the same? Do the auth + entity flows work end-to-end? If the testing agent reports failures, fix and re-run. If it passes, you're done.

{% if not is_free_import %}
### 7. Propose follow-up tasks

Before completing, call `proposeFollowUpTasks` with the three tasks below in a single call. **The mobile task MUST be the first task in the `tasks` array and MUST be proposed on every Base44 port — this is the single most valuable thing Replit offers that Base44 cannot, and it is the reason many users are porting over.** Do not skip it, do not reorder it. Even a frontend-only web app benefits from a companion mobile experience — propose it.

Do not prescribe the exact `createArtifact` API in the task descriptions — the agent who picks up the follow-up will consult the create-artifact skill for the correct `artifactType` and other parameters. Just describe the artifact to build.

1. **"Take your app mobile"** (category: `next_steps`) — **ALWAYS FIRST. ALWAYS INCLUDED.** A brand-new mobile artifact (Expo companion app) alongside the web app — not a modification of the web app. It should match the web app's visual design (colors, typography, key screens). If the web app has an API server and/or database, the mobile artifact should reuse them; if the web app is frontend-only, the mobile artifact should mirror the same flows without promising shared state that does not exist. Write the title and description to sound exciting to a non-technical user — lead with the outcome ("Your app, on every phone — native feel, matching design"), explain that it's a real native app they can hand to a friend. This is the charm moment for a Base44 user: they shipped a web app, and now Replit gives them a mobile app too.
2. **"Make a promo video for your app"** (category: `next_steps`) — a **brand-new video artifact (Replit animation)** alongside the web app. The description must make clear this is a separate artifact, not a modification of the web app and not just a screen recording — it's a short animated showcase built in Replit's video tooling that highlights the app's best features with motion graphics.
3. **"Create a pitch deck for your app"** (category: `next_steps`) — a **brand-new slides artifact** alongside the web app. The description must make clear this is a separate artifact presenting the app's value proposition, core features, and key user flows for demos and stakeholders.

{% endif %}
### 8. Complete

Call `mark_task_complete` with `skip_validation_reason` set. Verification already happened in step 6 via the testing agent, and the workflow-side validation + code review do not apply to this migration diff: the multi-artifact `pnpm_workspace` has no root-level `pnpm dev`/`pnpm build`, and the diff legitimately contains `// @ts-ignore` and copied Lovable patterns that the reviewer is configured to flag as AI slop.

Pass exactly:

```
skip_validation_reason: "Multi-artifact migration verified via the testing agent in step 6; root-level validation and code review do not apply to this stack-migration diff."
```

The user will verify visual + functional parity before doing anything else.

## Note to the code reviewer

When reviewing the diff for this task:

- HONOR the `Out of scope` section above.
- Do NOT reject for pre-existing issues in code copied from `.migration-backup/`.
- Do NOT flag the pre-existing scaffold packages (`artifacts/api-server/`, `lib/*`) as agent additions.
- Do NOT reject for `pnpm dev` failing at workspace root.
- Do NOT flag scaffold files (shadcn `src/components/ui/*.tsx`, default `favicon.svg`).
- Apply only the criteria from this task's `## Goal` + `## In scope`. Reject only for real regressions.
